Reflections 2,

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

     When you want to make an experimental change. When two people are working on something.

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    Creates the .git directory so you can begin tracking files in that directory

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

    The staging area is for things you are about to commit. It allows you to add only certain things to a commit, not the entire working directory.
