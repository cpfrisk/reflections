Reflections 1,

How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

     It highlighted the differences

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

     You could see the changes over time and go back to old versions if needed.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You don't have versions with very little changes or just versions with meaningful changes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Usually a program consists of multilple files and you want to save them all at once.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I don't know

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Knowing that you could always go back makes changes easier.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

   So many things.
